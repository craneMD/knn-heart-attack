# Heart Attack Prediction using KNN

This project uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict whether a patient is likely to have a heart attack based on medical data. The notebook includes:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Model training and K-value tuning
- Confusion matrix and classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall)
- Visualization of results

ðŸ“Š Built in Google Colab using:
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
